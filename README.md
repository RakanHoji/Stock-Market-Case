# Stock-Market-Case

(Stock Market Case), optimize a
Mean-Variance (MV) portfolio with stock which your group members selected* 
using five years (2016-2020) of daily data. Then, test the portfolio on all available 2021 data
(approximately 3 months: Jan., Feb., and most of March ending on Mar. 26th, 2021) as shown
in the example covered in class. Use daily (not monthly) data for calculating returns.
The optimization should use the minimum acceptable return of the SP500TR index for the
2016-2020 time period. If it is not possible to find a portfolio with this minimum acceptable return
with your selection of stocks, lower the minimum acceptable return value and add a sentence
with an explanation to the report.
